      "husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\n",

      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",

      "realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There\n",
      "was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in\n",
      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",

      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "      But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "      He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "      “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”       “ — yes, their son, Harry —”\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "      He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks.…\n",
      "      He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "      “Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”\n",
      "      And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "      Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "      As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw \n",
      "—\n",
      "and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "      “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "      The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "      Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "      “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?”\n",
      "      “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not\n",

      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",

      "whisper, a whisper about the Potters.…\n",
      "      Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er\n",
      "— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”\n",
      "      As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\n",
      "      “No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\n",
      "      “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting\n",

      "      “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",

      "In Chapter Two of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we are reintroduced to the Dursley family, who have been raising Harry for the past ten years. The chapter begins with a description of the Dursley household, which has hardly changed since Harry arrived on their doorstep as a baby. Dudley, Harry's cousin, is celebrating his birthday, and the Dursleys are busy preparing for the day. Harry, who sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, is woken up by his Aunt Petunia and is tasked with cooking breakfast for Dudley.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Dursleys prepare for Dudley's birthday celebrations, Harry is reminded of his own lack of attention and care from his family. He is constantly mistreated by the Dursleys, especially Dudley, who bullies and torments him. Despite this, Harry remains hopeful and tries to make the best of his situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Dudley's birthday, the Dursleys plan to take Dudley and his friend Piers to the zoo, leaving Harry behind with their neighbor, Mrs. Figg. However, when Mrs. Figg breaks her leg, the Dursleys are forced to take Harry to the zoo with them. While at the zoo, Harry has a chance encounter with a boa constrictor in the reptile house. The snake communicates with Harry, and when Dudley and Piers provoke it, the snake escapes from its enclosure, causing chaos in the zoo.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the incident at the zoo, Harry is punished by the Dursleys and forced to stay in his cupboard. Despite his mistreatment, Harry remains hopeful for a better future and dreams of a life beyond the Dursleys. The chapter ends with Harry reflecting on his past and the mysterious encounters he has had with strangers who seem to know him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Chapter Two sets the stage for Harry's journey and introduces the themes of family, mistreatment, and hope that will be central to the rest of the story. It also hints at the magical world that Harry is destined to discover.\n",

      "he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever\n",
      "punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer\n",
      "holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera,\n",
      "crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,\n",
      "knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n",
      "      Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s\n",
      "gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\n",
      "Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of\n",
      "the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in\n",
      "Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n",
      "      This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\n",
      "wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see\n",
      "a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary\n",
      "school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had\n",
      "been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was\n",
      "going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local\n",
      "public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n",
      "      “They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he\n",
      "told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”\n",
      "      “No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as\n",
      "horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley\n",
      "could work out what he’d said.\n",
      "      One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his\n",
      "Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as\n",
      "usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she\n",
      "didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and\n",
      "gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several\n",
      "years.\n",
      "      That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\n",
      "his brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\n",
      "knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly\n",
      "sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n",
      "      As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\n",
      "gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears\n",
      "and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so\n",
      "handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of\n",
      "his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went\n",
      "in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He\n",
      "went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in\n",
      "gray water.\n",
      "      “What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\n",
      "did if he dared to ask a question.\n",
      "      “Your new school uniform,” she said.\n",
      "      Harry looked in the bowl again.\n",
      "      “Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”\n",
      "      “Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s\n",
      "old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”\n",
      "      Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\n",
      "down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his\n",
      "first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin,\n",
      "probably.\n",
      "      Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of\n",
      "the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\n",
      "usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on\n",
      "the table.\n",
      "      They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n",
      "      “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n",
      "      “Make Harry get it.”\n",
      "      “Get the mail, Harry.”\n",
      "      “Make Dudley get it.”\n",
      "      “Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”\n",
      "      Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\n",
      "lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was\n",
      "vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and —\n",
      "a letter for Harry.\n",
      "      Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic\n",
      "band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no\n",
      "friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so\n",
      "plainly there could be no mistake:\n",
      "Mr. H. Potter\n",
      "The Cupboard under the Stairs\n",
      "4 Privet Drive\n",
      "Little Whinging\n",
      "Surrey\n",
      " \n",
      "The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\n",
      "address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\n",
      "      Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\n",
      "seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a\n",
      "large letter H.\n",
      "      “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you\n",
      "doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.\n",
      "      Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle\n",
      "Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow\n",
      "envelope.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\n",
      "the postcard.\n",
      "      “Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk.…”\n",
      "      “Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”\n",
      "      Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\n",
      "same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his\n",
      "hand by Uncle Vernon.\n",
      "      “That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n",
      "      “Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter\n",
      "open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\n",
      "than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the\n",
      "grayish white of old porridge.\n",
      "      “P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.\n",
      "      Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high\n",
      "out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a\n",
      "moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a\n",
      "choking noise.\n",
      "      “Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”\n",
      "      They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\n",
      "Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his\n",
      "father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.       “I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\n",
      "      “I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”\n",
      "      “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\n",
      "inside its envelope.\n",
      "      Harry didn’t move.\n",
      "      “I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.\n",
      "      “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.\n",
      "      “OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\n",
      "scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door\n",
      "behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who\n",
      "would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from\n",
      "one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n",
      "      “Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the\n",
      "address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think\n",
      "they’re watching the house?”\n",
      "      “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon\n",
      "wildly.\n",
      "      “But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we\n",
      "don’t want —”\n",
      "      Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down\n",
      "the kitchen.\n",
      "      “No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer…\n",
      "Yes, that’s best…we won’t do anything…”\n",
      "      “But —”\n",
      "      “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we\n",
      "took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”\n",
      " \n",
      "That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something\n",
      "he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n",
      "      “Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\n",
      "through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”\n",
      "      “No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.\n",
      "“I have burned it.”\n",
      "      “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”\n",
      "      “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\n",
      "ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which\n",
      "looked quite painful.\n",
      "      “Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\n",
      "thinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.\n",
      "      “Why?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”\n",
      "      The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\n",
      "Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where\n",
      "Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit\n",
      "into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he\n",
      "owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared\n",
      "around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera\n",
      "was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next\n",
      "door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which\n",
      "he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there\n",
      "was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at\n",
      "school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because\n",
      "Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only\n",
      "things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.\n",
      "      From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I\n",
      "don’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”\n",
      "      Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given\n",
      "anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter\n",
      "than up here without it.\n",
      " \n",
      "Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock.\n",
      "He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on\n",
      "purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof,\n",
      "and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time\n",
      "yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon\n",
      "and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n",
      "      When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\n",
      "to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his\n",
      "Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one!\n",
      "‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’”\n",
      "      With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\n",
      "hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground\n",
      "to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had\n",
      "grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused\n",
      "fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon\n",
      "straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.\n",
      "      “Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”\n",
      "      Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had\n",
      "moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first\n",
      "letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they\n",
      "didn’t fail. He had a plan.\n",
      " \n",
      "The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned\n",
      "it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole\n",
      "downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n",
      "      He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\n",
      "get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the\n",
      "dark hall toward the front door —\n",
      "      “AAAAARRRGH!”\n",
      "      Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on\n",
      "the doormat — something alive!\n",
      "      Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big,\n",
      "squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the\n",
      "foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do\n",
      "exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour\n",
      "and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into\n",
      "the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\n",
      "Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n",
      "      “I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\n",
      "pieces before his eyes.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed\n",
      "up the mail slot.\n",
      "      “See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they\n",
      "can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”\n",
      "      “I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”\n",
      "      “Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like\n",
      "you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\n",
      "fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n",
      " \n",
      "On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go\n",
      "through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the\n",
      "sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs\n",
      "bathroom.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\n",
      "out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he\n",
      "worked, and jumped at small noises.\n",
      " \n",
      "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry\n",
      "found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\n",
      "dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through\n",
      "the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the\n",
      "post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia\n",
      "shredded the letters in her food processor.\n",
      "      “Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in\n",
      "amazement.\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\n",
      "tired and rather ill, but happy.\n",
      "      “No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread\n",
      "marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”\n",
      "      Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and\n",
      "caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters\n",
      "came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry\n",
      "leapt into the air trying to catch one —\n",
      "      “Out! OUT!”\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\n",
      "When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\n",
      "Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming\n",
      "into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n",
      "      “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\n",
      "great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five\n",
      "minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No\n",
      "arguments!”\n",
      "      He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\n",
      "argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\n",
      "doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in\n",
      "the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he\n",
      "tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n",
      "      They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where\n",
      "they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\n",
      "drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n",
      "      “Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.\n",
      "      They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five\n",
      "television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without\n",
      "blowing up an alien on his computer.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\n",
      "outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and\n",
      "damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the\n",
      "windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…\n",
      " \n",
      "They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the\n",
      "next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their\n",
      "table.\n",
      "      “’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred\n",
      "of these at the front desk.”\n",
      "      She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n",
      " \n",
      "Mr. H. Potter\n",
      "Room 17\n",
      "Railview Hotel\n",
      "Cokeworth\n",
      " \n",
      "Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of\n",
      "the way. The woman stared.\n",
      "      “I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\n",
      "her from the dining room.\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested\n",
      "timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he\n",
      "was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,\n",
      "got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went\n",
      "again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across\n",
      "a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n",
      "      “Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late\n",
      "that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the\n",
      "car, and disappeared.\n",
      "      It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\n",
      "      “It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I\n",

      "      “I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”\n",

      "empty. There were only two rooms.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\n",

      "in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if\n",

      "In Chapter Three of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" titled \"Letters from No One,\" Harry experiences a tumultuous summer holiday with the Dursleys. Dudley's gang bullies Harry, and Dudley himself is preparing to attend Smeltings, a prestigious private school, while Harry is set to attend Stonewall High. Harry receives his first ever letter, addressed to him in his cupboard under the stairs, but Uncle Vernon intercepts and destroys it. As more letters arrive for Harry, Uncle Vernon becomes increasingly paranoid and attempts to escape the letters by taking the family on a wild journey, eventually ending up in a remote shack during a storm. As Harry turns eleven on his birthday, a mysterious knocking is heard at the door, signaling the beginning of a new and magical chapter in his life.\n",

      "      The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\n",

      "      A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\n",
      "completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but\n",
      "you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n",
      "      The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\n",
      "brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back\n",
      "into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look\n",

      "      “Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey.\n",

      "entering!”\n",
      "      “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a\n",

      "room.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n",
      "      “Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a\n",

      "some point, but it’ll taste all right.”\n",
      "      From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed\n",

      "      Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\n",
      "got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”\n",
      "      The giant chuckled.\n",
      "      “True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\n",

      "      He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.\n",

      "as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.\n",
      "      The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\n",
      "began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\n",
      "squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a\n",
      "bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\n",
      "Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a\n",
      "thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly\n",
      "burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\n",
      "sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”\n",
      "      The giant chuckled darkly.\n",

      "      He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\n",
      "anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as\n",
      "nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t\n",
      "really know who you are.”\n",

      "      “Sorry,” Harry said quickly.\n",
      "      “Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank\n",
      "back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’\n",

      "      He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The\n",
      "Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n",
      "      “Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy —\n",
      "this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”\n",
      "      Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all,\n",
      "and his marks weren’t bad.\n",
      "      “I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”\n",
      "      But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean.\n",
      "Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”\n",
      "      “What world?”\n",
      "      Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n",
      "      “DURSLEY!” he boomed.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that\n",
      "sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n",
      "      “But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re\n",
      "famous. You’re famous.”\n",
      "      “What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”\n",
      "      “Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through his\n",
      "hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n",
      "      “Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\n",
      "      Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n",
      "      “Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy\n",
      "anything!”\n",
      "      A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\n",

      "rage.\n",
      "      “You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it\n",
      "from him all these years?”\n",
      "      “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\n",
      "      “STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n",

      "“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.\n",
      "      “If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.\n",
      " \n",
      "Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know\n",
      "where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\n",
      "way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\n",
      "loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n",
      "      “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they\n",
      "climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n",
      "      Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\n",
      "was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\n",
      "hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell\n",
      "you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.\n",
      "Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there\n",
      "really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some\n",
      "huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the\n",
      "Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\n",
      "though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t\n",
      "help trusting him.\n",
      "      “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a\n",
      "famous place.”\n",
      "      It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry\n",
      "wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it.\n",
      "Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the\n",
      "other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the\n",
      "most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could\n",
      "mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n",
      "      For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\n",
      "sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\n",
      "long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\n",
      "quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\n",
      "when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\n",
      "at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”\n",
      "      “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\n",
      "      “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be\n",
      "—?”\n",
      "      The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n",
      "      “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what an\n",
      "honor.”\n",
      "      He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\n",
      "hand, tears in his eyes.\n",
      "      “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\n",
      "      Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\n",
      "woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid\n",
      "was beaming.\n",
      "      Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\n",
      "found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n",
      "      “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\n",
      "      “So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\n",
      "      “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\n",
      "      “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus\n",
      "Diggle.”\n",
      "      “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in\n",
      "his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\n",
      "      “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\n",
      "“Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again —\n",
      "Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n",
      "      A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\n",
      "eyes was twitching.\n",
      "      “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one\n",
      "of your teachers at Hogwarts.”\n",
      "      “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-\n",
      "can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\n",
      "      “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\n",
      "      “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as\n",
      "though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”\n",
      "He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve\n",
      "g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at\n",
      "the very thought.\n",
      "      But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\n",
      "took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\n",
      "make himself heard over the babble.       “Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\n",
      "      Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\n",
      "through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\n",
      "but a trash can and a few weeds.\n",
      "      Hagrid grinned at Harry.\n",
      "      “Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\n",
      "was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\n",
      "      “Is he always that nervous?”\n",
      "      “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’\n",
      "outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They\n",
      "say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with\n",
      "a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own\n",
      "subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\n",
      "      Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\n",
      "counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n",
      "      “Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”\n",
      "      He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n",
      "      The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a\n",
      "small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were\n",
      "facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\n",
      "street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n",
      "      “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\n",
      "      He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway.\n",
      "Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\n",
      "back into solid wall.\n",
      "      The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\n",
      "Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring —\n",
      "Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n",
      "      “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money\n",
      "first.”\n",
      "      Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\n",
      "direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\n",
      "shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\n",
      "outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon\n",
      "liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”\n",
      "      A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\n",
      "Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\n",
      "about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\n",
      "it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\n",
      "strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\n",
      "barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\n",
      "rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.…\n",
      "      “Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\n",
      "little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\n",
      "scarlet and gold, was —\n",
      "      “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\n",
      "stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\n",
      "a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\n",
      "feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\n",
      "doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n",
      "Enter, stranger, but take heed\n",
      "Of what awaits the sin of greed,\n",
      "For those who take, but do not earn,\n",
      "Must pay most dearly in their turn.\n",
      "So if you seek beneath our floors\n",
      "A treasure that was never yours,\n",
      "Thief, you have been warned, beware\n",
      "Of finding more than treasure there.\n",
      " \n",
      "“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\n",
      "vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\n",
      "behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\n",
      "examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\n",
      "count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\n",
      "of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n",
      "      “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some\n",
      "money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\n",
      "      “You have his key, sir?”\n",
      "      “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\n",
      "pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\n",
      "goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\n",
      "goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n",
      "      “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n",
      "      The goblin looked at it closely.\n",
      "      “That seems to be in order.”       “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\n",
      "importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault\n",
      "seven hundred and thirteen.”\n",
      "      The goblin read the letter carefully.\n",
      "      “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone\n",
      "take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\n",
      "      Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\n",
      "biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\n",
      "the doors leading off the hall.\n",
      "      “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?”\n",
      "Harry asked.\n",
      "      “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts\n",
      "business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\n",
      "      Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\n",
      "marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\n",
      "torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\n",
      "floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\n",
      "them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\n",
      "      At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\n",
      "to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\n",
      "The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t\n",
      "steering.\n",
      "      Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\n",
      "wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\n",
      "twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even\n",
      "deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\n",
      "from the ceiling and floor.\n",
      "      “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s\n",
      "the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\n",
      "      “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions\n",
      "just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\n",
      "      He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\n",
      "door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\n",
      "his knees from trembling.\n",
      "      Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\n",
      "and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\n",
      "silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n",
      "      “All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\n",
      "      All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\n",
      "they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\n",
      "been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n",
      "      Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n",
      "      “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to\n",
      "a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should\n",
      "be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to\n",
      "Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\n",
      "slowly?”\n",
      "      “One speed only,” said Griphook.\n",
      "      They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\n",
      "colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\n",
      "underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\n",
      "at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "      Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n",
      "      “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\n",
      "with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n",
      "      “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the\n",
      "door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\n",
      "      “How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.\n",
      "      “About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n",
      "      Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\n",
      "Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\n",
      "at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\n",
      "little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\n",
      "and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\n",
      "better than to ask.\n",
      "      “Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way\n",
      "back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\n",
      " \n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\n",
      "Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\n",
      "didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\n",
      "was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than\n",
      "even Dudley had ever had.\n",
      "      “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\n",
      "Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\n",
      "off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling\n",
      "nervous.\n",
      "      Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n",
      "      “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot\n",
      "here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\n",
      "      In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\n",
      "footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\n",
      "stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\n",
      "to pin it to the right length.\n",
      "      “Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street\n",
      "looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m\n",
      "going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t\n",
      "have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in\n",
      "somehow.”\n",
      "      Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n",
      "      “Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Play Quidditch at all?”\n",
      "      “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n",
      "      “I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house,\n",
      "and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n",
      "      “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll\n",
      "be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\n",
      "I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\n",
      "      “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\n",
      "interesting.\n",
      "      “I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\n",
      "window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\n",
      "ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\n",
      "      “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.\n",
      "“He works at Hogwarts.”\n",
      "      “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\n",
      "      “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\n",
      "every second.\n",
      "      “Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school\n",
      "grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.”\n",
      "      “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\n",
      "      “Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where\n",
      "are your parents?”\n",
      "      “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into\n",
      "the matter with this boy.\n",
      "      “Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our\n",
      "kind, weren’t they?”\n",
      "      “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\n",
      "      “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just\n",
      "not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\n",
      "have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\n",

They visit Gringotts, the wizarding bank run by goblins, where Harry discovers his parents left him a fortune.

      "this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms\n",
      "with a nasty grin on his face.\n",
      "      “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform\n",
      "should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do\n",
      "they?”\n",
      "      He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\n",
      "one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the\n",
      "middle, nothing at all.\n",
      "      “Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\n",
      "left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All\n",
      "three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of\n",
      "Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.\n",
      "      He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and\n",
      "three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t\n",
      "even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as\n",
      "though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\n",
      "the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the\n",
      "end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\n",
      "hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten\n",
      "minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\n",
      "was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket\n",
      "full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n",
      "      Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\n",
      "tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he\n",
      "should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between\n",
      "platforms nine and ten.\n",
      "      At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\n",
      "few words of what they were saying.\n",
      "      “— packed with Muggles, of course —”\n",
      "      Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to\n",
      "four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\n",
      "Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.\n",
      "      Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\n",
      "did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n",
      "      “Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.\n",
      "      “Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\n",
      "holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go…”\n",
      "      “You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go\n",
      "first.”\n",
      "      What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.\n",
      "Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy\n",
      "reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists\n",
      "came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared\n",
      "away, the boy had vanished.\n",
      "      “Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.\n",
      "      “I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call\n",
      "yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”\n",
      "      “Sorry, George, dear.”\n",
      "      “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had\n",
      "gone — but how had he done it?\n",
      "      Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\n",
      "almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.\n",
      "      There was nothing else for it.\n",
      "      “Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.\n",
      "      “Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”\n",
      "      She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\n",
      "gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to —”\n",
      "      “How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n",
      "      “Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the\n",
      "barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll\n",
      "crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.\n",
      "Go on, go now before Ron.”\n",
      "      “Er — okay,” said Harry.\n",
      "      He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\n",
      "solid.\n",
      "      He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms\n",
      "nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that\n",
      "barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a\n",
      "heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to\n",
      "stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes\n",
      "ready for the crash —\n",
      "      It didn’t come…he kept on running…he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam\n",
      "engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said\n",
      "Hogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a\n",
      "wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine\n",
      "and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\n",
      "      Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\n",
      "while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted\n",
      "to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of\n",
      "heavy trunks.\n",
      "      The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\n",
      "out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\n",
      "pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a\n",
      "round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”\n",
      "      “Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\n",
      "      A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.       “Give us a look, Lee, go on.”\n",
      "      The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\n",
      "shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n",
      "      Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\n",
      "compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\n",
      "started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\n",
      "the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "      “Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through\n",
      "the barrier.\n",
      "      “Yes, please,” Harry panted.\n",
      "      “Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”\n",
      "      With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\n",
      "the compartment.\n",
      "      “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n",
      "      “What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s\n",
      "lightning scar.\n",
      "      “Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you —?”\n",
      "      “He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.\n",
      "      “What?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter.” chorused the twins.\n",
      "      “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”\n",
      "      The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\n",
      "his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.\n",
      "      “Fred? George? Are you there?”\n",
      "      “Coming, Mom.”\n",
      "      With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n",
      "      Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch\n",
      "the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their\n",
      "mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n",
      "      “Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”\n",
      "      The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\n",
      "began rubbing the end of his nose.\n",
      "      “Mom — geroff” He wriggled free.\n",
      "      “Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the\n",
      "twins.\n",
      "      “Shut up,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “Where’s Percy?” said their mother.\n",
      "      “He’s coming now.”       The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\n",
      "billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his\n",
      "chest with the letter P on it.\n",
      "      “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got\n",
      "two compartments to themselves —”\n",
      "      “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great\n",
      "surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”\n",
      "      “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the\n",
      "other twin. “Once —”\n",
      "      “Or twice —”\n",
      "      “A minute —”\n",
      "      “All summer —”\n",
      "      “Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.\n",
      "      “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.\n",
      "      “Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well,\n",
      "have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”\n",
      "      She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n",
      "      “Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more\n",
      "owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —”\n",
      "      “Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”\n",
      "      “Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”\n",
      "      “It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”\n",
      "      “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”\n",
      "      “Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and\n",
      "his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n",
      "      “Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”\n",
      "      Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.\n",
      "      “You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know\n",
      "who he is?”\n",
      "      “Who?”\n",
      "      “Harry Potter!”\n",
      "      Harry heard the little girl’s voice.\n",
      "      “Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....”\n",
      "      “You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you\n",
      "goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”\n",
      "      “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”\n",
      "      “Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so\n",
      "polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”\n",
      "      “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?”\n",
      "      Their mother suddenly became very stern.\n",
      "      “I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs\n",
      "reminding of that on his first day at school.”\n",
      "      “All right, keep your hair on.”\n",
      "      A whistle sounded.\n",
      "      “Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\n",
      "train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their\n",
      "younger sister began to cry.\n",
      "      “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”\n",
      "      “We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.”\n",

      "      “Only joking, Mom.”\n",
      "      The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their\n",
      "sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it\n",
      "gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n",
      "      Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\n",
      "corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He\n",
      "didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was\n",
      "leaving behind.\n",
      "      The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\n",
      "came in.\n",
      "      “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.\n",
      "“Everywhere else is full.”\n",
      "      Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and\n",
      "then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw\n",
      "he still had a black mark on his nose.\n",
      "      “Hey, Ron.”\n",
      "      The twins were back.\n",
      "      “Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a\n",
      "giant tarantula down there.”\n",
      "      “Right,” mumbled Ron.\n",
      "      “Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\n",
      "George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”\n",
      "      “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut\n",
      "behind them.\n",
      "      “Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\n",
      "      Harry nodded.\n",
      "      “Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — you know…”\n",
      "      He pointed at Harry’s forehead.\n",
      "      Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n",
      "      “So that’s where You-Know-Who —?”\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\n",
      "      “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\n",
      "      “Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”\n",
      "      “Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\n",
      "though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the\n",
      "window again.\n",
      "      “Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as\n",
      "interesting as Ron found him.\n",
      "      “Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin\n",
      "who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”\n",
      "      “So you must know loads of magic already.”\n",
      "      The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\n",
      "boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n",
      "      “I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”\n",
      "      “Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\n",
      "though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”\n",
      "      “Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the\n",
      "sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to.\n",
      "Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain\n",
      "of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but\n",
      "they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.\n",
      "Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,\n",
      "because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.\n",
      "I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.”\n",
      "      Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "      “His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy\n",
      "got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I\n",
      "mean, I got Scabbers instead.”\n",
      "      Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he\n",
      "went back to staring out of the window.\n",
      "      Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to\n",
      "afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago,\n",
      "and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never\n",
      "getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.       “…and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a\n",
      "wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —”\n",
      "      Ron gasped.\n",
      "      “What?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked\n",
      "and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —”\n",
      "      “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I\n",

      "      Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\n",
      "corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything\n",

      "      Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears\n",

      "“Weird!”\n",
      "      Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\n",
      "gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking\n",
      "at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off\n",
      "them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\n",
      "Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\n",

      "like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\n",

      "tearful.\n",
      "      “Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\n",

      "      “Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”\n",
      "      He left.\n",
      "      “Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d\n",

      "      He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n",

      "wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n",
      "      “Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy\n",
      "sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n",
      "      “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl\n",
      "wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n",
      "      “Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”\n",
      "      She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n",
      "      “Er — all right.”\n",
      "      He cleared his throat.\n",

      "“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n",
      "Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”\n",
      " \n",
      "      He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "      “Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good,\n",
      "is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.\n",
      "Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\n",

      "are you?”\n",
      "      She said all this very fast.\n",
      "      Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\n",
      "hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.\n",
      "      “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I\n",

      "History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\n",
      "the Twentieth Century.”\n",
      "      “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\n",
      "      “Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it\n",
      "was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve\n",
      "been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too\n",
      "bad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better\n",
      "change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\n",
      "      And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n",
      "      “Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his\n",

      "was a dud.”\n",
      "      “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\n",
      "      “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\n",
      "“Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t\n",
      "suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”\n",
      "      “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n",

      "now that they’ve left, anyway?”\n",
      "      Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school.\n",
      "      “Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing\n",
      "something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all\n",
      "over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles —\n",
      "someone tried to rob a high security vault.”\n",
      "      Harry stared.\n",
      "      “Really? What happened to them?”\n",
      "      “Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My\n",
      "dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they\n",
      "don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared\n",
      "when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”\n",
      "      Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\n",
      "of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\n",
      "part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\n",
      "“Voldemort” without worrying.\n",
      "      “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\n",
      "      “Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.\n",
      "      “What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in\n",
      "the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\n",
      "positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his\n",
      "brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just\n",
      "taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\n",
      "slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n",
      "      Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\n",
      "the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\n",
      "lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "      “Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry\n",
      "Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\n",
      "thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\n",
      "looked like bodyguards.\n",
      "      “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly,\n",
      "noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\n",
      "      Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\n",
      "Malfoy looked at him.\n",
      "      “Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\n",
      "father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\n",
      "they can afford.”\n",
      "      He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families\n",
      "are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the\n",
      "wrong sort. I can help you there.”\n",
      "      He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.\n",
      "      “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said\n",
      "coolly.\n",
      "      Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n",
      "      “I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit\n",
      "politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good\n",
      "for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\n",
      "and it’ll rub off on you.”\n",
      "      Both Harry and Ron stood up.\n",
      "      “Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n",
      "      “Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.\n",
      "      “Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\n",
      "Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n",
      "      “But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food\n",
      "and you still seem to have some.”\n",
      "      Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt\n",
      "forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n",
      "      Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep\n",
      "into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\n",
      "Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\n",
      "were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps,\n",
      "because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n",
      "      “What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the\n",
      "floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n",
      "      “I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\n",

      "      “I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first\n",
      "to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been\n",
      "bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an\n",
      "excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you\n",
      "with something?”\n",
      "      “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the\n",

      "fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!”\n",
      "      “Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would\n",
      "you mind leaving while we change?”\n",
      "      “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving\n",
      "very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy\n",
      "voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\n",
      "      Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\n",
      "getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The\n",
      "train did seem to be slowing down.\n",
      "      He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\n",
      "Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n",
      "      A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\n",
      "minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the\n",
      "school separately.”\n",
      "      Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\n",
      "his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\n",
      "the crowd thronging the corridor.\n",
      "      The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\n",
      "way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\n",
      "cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\n",
      "Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,\n",
      "Harry?”       Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n",
      "      “C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’\n",
      "years follow me!”\n",
      "      Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\n",
      "steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there\n",
      "must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing\n",
      "his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n",
      "      “Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his\n",
      "shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”\n",
      "      There was a loud “Oooooh!”\n",
      "      The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black\n",
      "lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in\n",
      "the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n",
      "      “No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\n",
      "boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their\n",
      "boat by Neville and Hermione.\n",
      "      “Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then\n",
      "— FORWARD!”\n",
      "      And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake,\n",

      "which it stood.\n",
      "      “Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all\n",
      "bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid\n",
      "a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which\n",
      "seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind\n",
      "of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n",

      "      “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\n",
      "clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last\n",
      "onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n",
      "      They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak\n",

      "      “Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term\n",
      "banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you\n",
      "will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony\n",
      "because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family\n",
      "within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your\n",

      "      “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\n",
      "Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\n",
      "outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will\n",
      "earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end\n",
      "of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great\n",
      "honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n",
      "      “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\n",

      "under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n",
      "      “I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "“Please wait quietly.”\n",
      "      She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n",
      "      “How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.\n",
      "      “Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\n",
      "joking.”\n",
      "      Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school?\n",
      "But he didn’t know any magic yet —what on earth would he have to do? He\n",
      "hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around\n",
      "anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\n",
      "much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the\n",
      "spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not\n",
      "to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to\n",
      "take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his\n",

      "Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\n",
      "      Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air —\n",
      "several people behind him screamed.\n",
      "      “What the —?”\n",
      "      He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\n",
      "streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they\n",
      "glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first\n",
      "years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying:\n",
      "“Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”\n",
      "      “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\n",

      "      A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\n",
      "      Nobody answered.\n",

      "Sorted, I suppose?”\n",
      "      A few people nodded mutely.\n",
      "      “Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old house, you\n",

      "to start.”\n",
      "      Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\n",
      "through the opposite wall.       “Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and\n",
      "follow me.”\n",
      "      Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\n",
      "behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the\n",
      "chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great\n",
      "Hall.\n",
      "      Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\n",
      "lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four\n",
      "long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid\n",
      "with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\n",
      "table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years\n",
      "up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the\n",
      "teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale\n",
      "lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students,\n",
      "the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked\n",
      "upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione\n",
      "whisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts,\n",
      "A History.”\n",
      "      It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great\n",
      "Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.\n",
      "      Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently\n",
      "placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a\n",
      "pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt\n",
      "Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.\n",
      "      \n",
      "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\n",
      "that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now\n",
      "staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete\n",
      "silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth —\n",
      "and the hat began to sing:\n",
      " \n",
      "“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\n",
      "But don’t judge on what you see,\n",
      "I’ll eat myself if you can find\n",
      "A smarter hat than me.\n",
      "You can keep your bowlers black,\n",
      "Your top hats sleek and tall,\n",
      "For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n",
      "And I can cap them all.\n",
      "There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see,\n",
      "So try me on and I will tell you\n",
      "Where you ought to be.\n",
      "You might belong in Gryffindor,\n",
      "Where dwell the brave at heart,\n",
      "Their daring, nerve, and chivalry\n",
      "Set Gryffindors apart;\n",
      "You might belong in Hufflepuff,\n",
      "Where they are just and loyal,\n",

      "Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n",
      "if you’ve a ready mind,\n",
      "Where those of wit and learning,\n",
      "Will always find their kind;\n",
      "Or perhaps in Slytherin\n",
      "You’ll make your real friends,\n",
      "Those cunning folk use any means\n",
      "To achieve their ends.\n",
      "So put me on! Don’t be afraid!\n",
      "And don’t get in a flap!\n",
      "You’re in safe hands (though I have none)\n",
      "For I’m a Thinking Cap!”\n",
      " \n",
      "The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to\n",
      "each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n",
      "      “So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill\n",
      "Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\n",
      "      Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having\n",
      "to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone\n",
      "watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or\n",
      "quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house\n",
      "for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\n",
      "      Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\n",
      "parchment.\n",
      "      “When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be\n",

      "imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like\n",
      "an unpleasant lot.\n",
      "      He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked\n",
      "for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,\n",

      "Potter.”\n",
      "      Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\n",
      "continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple\n",
      "potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them\n",
      "weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except\n",
      "Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the\n",
      "perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green\n",
      "smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to\n",
      "melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across\n",
      "the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion\n",
      "when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all\n",
      "over his arms and legs.\n",
      "      “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\n",
      "wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the\n",
      "cauldron off the fire?”\n",
      "      Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\n",
      "      “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\n",
      "rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\n",
      "      “You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\n",
      "he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point\n",
      "you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”\n",
      "      This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\n",

      "      As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind\n",
      "was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his\n",

      "      “Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and\n",
      "George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”\n",
      "      At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\n",
      "grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden\n",
      "forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\n",
      "      When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\n",
      "several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang —\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "      Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n",
      "      “Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\n",
      "      He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\n",
      "black boarhound.\n",
      "      There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from\n",
      "the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a\n",
      "massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n",
      "      “Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded\n",
      "straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as\n",
      "fierce as he looked.\n",
      "      “This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\n",
      "large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n",
      "      “Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”\n",
      "      The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\n",
      "teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all\n",
      "about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all\n",

      "      Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not\n",
      "to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n",

Snape's disdain for Harry becomes evident during a disastrous potions lesson where Neville accidentally creates a dangerous potion that burns holes in the floor and causes boils to erupt on his skin.\n",

      "      The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\n",

      "Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you\n",

      "too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n",
      "      Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without\n",
      "sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\n",

      "      “Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\n",
      "cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared\n",

      "off the broom and —\n",
      "      WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the\n",
      "grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to\n",
      "drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\n",
      "      Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n",
      "      “Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right,\n",

      "      She turned to the rest of the class.\n",
      "      “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\n",

      "Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”\n",
      "      “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\n",

      "up a tree?”\n",
      "      “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\n",
      "and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the\n",
      "topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”\n",

      "through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce\n",
      "joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this\n",
      "was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even\n",

      "into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n",
      "      Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then\n",
      "start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next\n",

      "in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom\n",
      "straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched\n",
      "safely in his fist.\n",
      "      “HARRY POTTER!”\n",

      "      Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as\n",
      "he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward\n",
      "the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say\n",
      "something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his\n",
      "voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him;\n",
      "he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks.\n",
      "He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he\n",
      "turned up on the doorstep?\n",
      "      Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\n",
      "McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched\n",
      "along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking\n",
      "him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\n",
      "gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he\n",
      "imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped\n",
      "around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.\n",
      "      Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\n",
      "and poked her head inside.\n",
      "      “Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?”\n",
      "      Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to\n",
      "use on him?\n",
      "      But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\n",
      "of Flitwick’s class looking confused.\n",
      "      “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on\n",
      "up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n",
      "      “In here.”\n",
      "      Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n",
      "      “Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\n",
      "clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the\n",
      "door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n",
      "      “Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”\n",
      "      Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n",
      "      “Are you serious, Professor?”\n",
      "      “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural.\n",
      "I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,\n",
      "Potter?”\n",
      "      Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he\n",
      "didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to\n",
      "his legs.\n",
      "      “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor\n",
      "McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t\n",
      "have done it.”\n",
      "      Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n",
      "      “Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\n",
      "      “Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall\n",
      "explained.\n",
      "      “He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around\n",
      "Harry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent\n",
      "broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\n",
      "      “I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-\n",

      "      Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n",
      "      “I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\n",
      "about punishing you.”\n",
      "      Then she suddenly smiled.\n",

      "“You’re joking.”\n",
      "      It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\n",
      "when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak\n",
      "and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.\n",
      "      “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest\n",
      "house player in about —”       “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt\n",
      "particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”\n",
      "      Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n",
      "      “I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood\n",
      "wants to keep it a secret.”\n",
      "      Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and\n",
      "hurried over.\n",
      "      “Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the\n",
      "team too — Beaters.”\n",
      "      “I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said\n",
      "Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be\n",
      "brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\n",
      "      “Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret\n",
      "passageway out of the school.”\n",
      "      “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\n",
      "in our first week. See you.”\n",
      "      Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\n",
      "turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n",
      "      “Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\n",
      "Muggles?”\n",
      "      “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got\n",
      "your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at\n",
      "all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,\n",
      "neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n",
      "      “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you\n",
      "want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard\n",
      "of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\n",
      "      “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s\n",
      "yours?”\n",
      "      Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n",
      "      “Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy\n",
      "room; that’s always unlocked.”\n",
      "      When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\n",
      "      “What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re\n",
      "my second?”\n",
      "      “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting\n",
      "started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added\n",
      "quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The\n",
      "most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse,\n",
      "anyway.”\n",
      "      “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\n",
      "      “Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.\n",
      "      “Excuse me.”\n",
      "      They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n",
      "      “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\n",
      "      Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n",
      "      “I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”\n",
      "      “Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\n",
      "      “— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of\n",
      "the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s\n",
      "really very selfish of you.”\n",
      "      “And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Good-bye,” said Ron.\n",
      " \n",
      "All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry\n",
      "thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep\n",
      "(Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving\n",
      "him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I\n",
      "can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were\n",
      "going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his\n",
      "luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering\n",
      "face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat\n",
      "Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.\n",
      "      “Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”\n",
      "      They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\n",
      "the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\n",
      "room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs\n",
      "into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a\n",
      "voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this,\n",
      "Harry.”\n",
      "      A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\n",
      "and a frown.\n",
      "      “You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”\n",
      "      “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect,\n",
      "he’d put a stop to this.”\n",
      "      Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n",
      "      “Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n",
      "      Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\n",
      "the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n",
      "      “Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I\n",
      "don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got\n",

      "      “Go away.”\n",
      "      “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re\n",
      "on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”\n",
      "      But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the\n",
      "portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty\n",
      "painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked\n",
      "out of Gryffindor tower.\n",
      "      “Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.\n",
      "      “That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be\n",
      "late.”\n",
      "      They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught\n",
      "up with them.\n",
      "      “I’m coming with you,” she said.\n",
      "      “You are not.”\n",

      "you can back me up.”\n",
      "      “You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.\n",
      "      “Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.”\n",
      "      It was a sort of snuffling.\n",
      "      “Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n",
      "      It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast\n",
      "asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n",
      "      “Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t\n",
      "remember the new password to get in to bed.”\n",
      "      “Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t\n",

      "      “How’s your arm?” said Harry.\n",
      "      “Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in\n",
      "about a minute.”\n",
      "      “Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you\n",
      "later —”\n",
      "      “Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”\n",
      "      Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\n",
      "Neville.\n",
      "      “If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse\n",
      "of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”\n",
      "      Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\n",
      "Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all\n",
      "forward.\n",
      "      They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high\n",
      "windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they\n",
      "were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the\n",
      "trophy room.\n",
      "      Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases\n",
      "glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues\n",
      "winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping\n",
      "their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case\n",
      "Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n",
      "      “He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.\n",
      "      Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just\n",
      "raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.\n",
      "      “Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”\n",
      "      It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\n",
      "at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently\n",
      "toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped\n",
      "round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n",
      "      “They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.”\n",
      "      “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\n",
      "creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\n",
      "nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he\n",
      "tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a\n",
      "suit of armor.\n",
      "      The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n",
      "      “RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\n",
      "looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the\n",
      "doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without\n",
      "any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a\n",
      "tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came\n",
      "out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy\n",
      "room.       “I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and\n",
      "wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n",
      "      I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\n",
      "“I — told — you.”\n",

      "in front of them.\n",
      "      It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n",

      "      “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes\n",
      "glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”\n",
      "      “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\n",
      "big mistake.\n",

      "BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”\n",
      "      Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\n",
      "corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.\n",

      "      The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut\n",
      "it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n",
      "      “Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”\n",

      "      “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”       “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying\n",

      "bathrobe for the last minute. “What?”\n",
      "      Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\n",

      "everything that had happened so far.\n",
      "      They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor.\n",
      "The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\n",
      "forbidden.\n",
      "      They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\n",
      "filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs\n",
      "of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three\n",
      "drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n",
      "      It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew\n",
      "that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance\n",
      "had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no\n",
      "mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n",
      "      Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take\n",
      "Filch.\n",
      "      They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\n",
      "almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for\n",
      "them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly\n",
      "cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them\n",
      "and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the\n",
      "Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n",
      "      “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their\n",
      "bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n",
      "      “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait\n",
      "swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed,\n",
      "trembling, into armchairs.\n",
      "      It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\n",
      "as if he’d never speak again.\n",
      "      “What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\n",

      "…”\n",
      "      “So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an\n",

      "      “Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\n",
      "      Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n",
      "      Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\n",

      "his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that\n",
      "night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\n",
      "and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n",
      "      “Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\n",
      "      Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\n",
      "looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\n",
      "neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n",
      "      As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\n",
      "toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\n",
      "of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\n",
      "enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\n",
      "poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\n",
      "Muggle children blew bubbles  through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n",
      "      Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\n",
      "and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the\n",
      "goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\n",
      "turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n",
      "      “Hey, Potter, come down!”\n",
      "      Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\n",
      "arm. Harry landed next to him.\n",
      "      “Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall\n",
      "meant…you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this\n",
      "evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\n",
      "      He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n",
      "      “Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\n",
      "if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\n",
      "are called Chasers.”\n",
      "      “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\n",
      "about the size of a soccer ball.\n",
      "      “This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the\n",
      "Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\n",
      "Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”\n",
      "      “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,”\n",
      "Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”\n",
      "      “What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\n",
      "      “Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\n",
      "      “Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m\n",
      "Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\n",
      "from scoring.”\n",
      "      “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to\n",
      "remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\n",
      "they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n",
      "      “I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\n",
      "      He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n",
      "      “I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two\n",
      "are the Bludgers.”\n",
      "      He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\n",
      "the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\n",
      "straps holding them inside the box.\n",
      "      “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\n",
      "Bludgers.\n",
      "      At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\n",
      "Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\n",
      "sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then\n",
      "shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n",
      "      “See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\n",
      "and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\n",
      "players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the\n",
      "Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\n",
      "and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”\n",
      "      “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\n",
      "goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled\n",
      "off.\n",
      "      “Very good,” said Wood.\n",
      "      “Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he\n",
      "sounded offhand.\n",
      "      “Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\n",
      "worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And\n",
      "you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”\n",
      "      “— unless they crack my head open.”\n",
      "      “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I\n",
      "mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”       Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\n",
      "Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\n",
      "large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n",
      "      “This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball\n",
      "of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the\n",
      "Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\n",
      "Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because\n",
      "whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\n",
      "points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A\n",
      "game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n",
      "— I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\n",
      "the players could get some sleep.\n",
      "      “Well, that’s it any questions?”\n",
      "      Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\n",
      "doing it that was going to be the problem.\n",
      "      “We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it\n",
      "back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few\n",
      "of these.”\n",
      "      He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\n",
      "minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\n",
      "hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n",
      "      Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\n",
      "hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.\n",
      "      “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood\n",
      "happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn\n",
      "out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\n",
      "hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\n",
      "three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\n",
      "believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The\n",
      "castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were\n",
      "becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n",
      "      On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\n",
      "pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick\n",
      "announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\n",
      "something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s\n",
      "toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to\n",
      "practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\n",
      "Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier\n",
      "about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick\n",
      "had arrived.\n",
      "      “Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!”\n",
      "squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.\n",
      "“Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words\n",
      "properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’\n",
      "instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”\n",
      "      It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\n",
      "feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.\n",
      "Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it —\n",
      "Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n",
      "      Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.\n",
      "      “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a\n",
      "windmill.\n",
      "      “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-\n",
      "dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”\n",
      "      “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\n",
      "      Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\n",
      "“Wingardium Leviosa!”\n",

      "heads.\n",

      "Miss Granger’s done it!”\n",
      "      Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n",
      "      “It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed\n",
      "their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\n",
      "      Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\n",
      "Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "      “I think she heard you.”\n",
      "      “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed\n",

      "On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron\n",
      "overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in\n",

      "      Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\n",
      "down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They\n",
      "had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n",
      "      “Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n",
      "      Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\n",
      "corridor and disappeared from view.\n",
      "      “What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the\n",
      "dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\n",
      "      “Search me.”\n",
      "      Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps.\n",

      "      “Can you smell something?”\n",
      "      Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\n",
      "socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n",
      "      And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\n",
      "gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\n",
      "was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\n",
      "emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n",
      "      It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\n",
      "its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\n",
      "coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\n",
      "coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\n",
      "dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n",
      "      The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\n",
      "ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n",
      "      “The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”\n",
      "      “Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\n",
      "      They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t\n",
      "about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\n",
      "slam the door, and lock it.\n",
      "      “Yes!”\n",
      "      Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as\n",
      "they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a\n",
      "high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just\n",
      "chained up.\n",
      "      “Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n",
      "      “It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\n",
      "      “Hermione!” they said together.\n",
      "      It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\n",
      "Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\n",
      "their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n",
      "      Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\n",
      "she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\n",
      "walls as it went.\n",
      "      “Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw\n",
      "it as hard as he could against the wall.\n",
      "      The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\n",
      "stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n",
      "      “Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\n",
      "threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\n",
      "shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward\n",
      "Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n",
      "      “Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\n",
      "the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth\n",
      "open with terror.\n",
      "      The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\n",
      "roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n",
      "      Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\n",
      "took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck\n",
      "from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will\n",
      "notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been\n",
      "in his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.\n",
      "      Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\n",
      "clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch\n",
      "him a terrible blow with the club.\n",
      "      Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\n",
      "— not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that\n",
      "came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!”\n",
      "      The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the\n",
      "air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s\n",
      "head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that\n",
      "made the whole room tremble.\n",
      "      Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\n",
      "standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n",
      "      It was Hermione who spoke first.\n",
      "      “Is it — dead?”\n",
      "      “I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.”\n",
      "      He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered\n",
      "in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n",
      "      “Urgh — troll boogers.”\n",
      "      He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.\n",
      "      A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\n",
      "They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,\n",
      "someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment\n",
      "later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed\n",
      "by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n",
      "      Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\n",
      "Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of\n",
      "winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.\n",
      "      “What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with\n",
      "cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his\n",
      "wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your\n",
      "dormitory?”\n",
      "      Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\n",
      "wished Ron would put his wand down.\n",
      "      Then a small voice came out of the shadows.\n",
      "      “Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”\n",
      "      “Miss Granger!”\n",
      "      Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n",

      "my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”\n",
      "      Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\n",
      "teacher?\n",
      "      “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its\n",
      "nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come\n",
      "and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”\n",
      "      Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.\n",

      "mountain troll on your own?”\n",
      "      Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\n",
      "person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\n",
      "get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\n",
      "      “Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all,\n",

      "      They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had\n",

      "where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the\n",
      "Christmas decorations.\n",
      "      “Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”\n",
      "      The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all\n",
      "around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around\n",
      "the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of\n",
      "candles.\n",
      "      “How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.\n",
      "      “Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve\n",
      "got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”\n",
      "      “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor\n",
      "Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing\n",
      "them over the branches of the new tree.\n",
      "      “The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just before\n",
      "the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\n",
      "      “Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you\n",
      "mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”       “You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh —\n",
      "drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”\n",
      "      “We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.\n",
      "      “Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added. “We\n",
      "must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him\n",
      "anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”\n",
      "      “I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.\n",
      "      “Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid\n",
      "looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n",
      "      They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since\n",
      "Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\n",
      "was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin,\n",
      "not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t\n",
      "in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our\n",
      "Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A\n",
      "Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the\n",
      "sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves;\n",
      "hundreds of narrow rows.\n",
      "      Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search\n",
      "while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the\n",
      "shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been\n",
      "wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\n",
      "needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the\n",
      "restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the books\n",
      "containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by\n",
      "older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n",
      "      “What are you looking for, boy?”\n",
      "      “Nothing,” said Harry.\n",
      "      Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n",
      "      “You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”\n",
      "      Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the\n",
      "library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam\n",
      "Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them,\n",
      "but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n",
      "      Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\n",
      "anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks,\n",
      "after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising\n",
      "they’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without\n",
      "Madam Pince breathing down their necks.       Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\n",
      "They went off to lunch.\n",
      "      “You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione.\n",
      "“And send me an owl if you find anything.”\n",
      "      “And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron.\n",
      "“It’d be safe to ask them.”\n",
      "      “Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\n",
      " \n",
      "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to\n",
      "think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\n",
      "common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good\n",
      "armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\n",
      "toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of\n",
      "getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t\n",
      "work.\n",
      "      Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\n",
      "Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like\n",
      "directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything\n",
      "else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this\n",
      "case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron\n",
      "knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n",
      "      Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they\n",
      "didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting\n",
      "different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t\n",
      "you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.”\n",
      "      On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for\n",
      "the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early\n",
      "in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at\n",
      "the foot of his bed.\n",
      "      “Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\n",
      "pulled on his bathrobe.\n",
      "      “You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!”\n",
      "      “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\n",
      "was a lot bigger than Harry’s.\n",
      "      Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\n",
      "scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\n",
      "flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit\n",
      "like an owl.\n",
      "      A second, very small parcel contained a note.       \n",
      "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From\n",
      "Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\n",
      "      “That’s friendly,” said Harry.\n",
      "      Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n",
      "      “Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is money?”\n",
      "      “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. “Hagrid\n",
      "and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”\n",
      "      “I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and\n",
      "pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any\n",
      "presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.”\n",
      "      Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\n",
      "emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n",
      "      “Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own,\n",
      "“and mine’s always maroon.”\n",
      "      “That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\n",
      "tasty.\n",
      "      His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs\n",
      "from Hermione.\n",
      "      This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light.\n",
      "He unwrapped it.\n",
      "      Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay\n",
      "in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n",
      "      “I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\n",
      "Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is —\n",
      "they’re really rare, and really valuable.”\n",
      "      “What is it?”\n",
      "      Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\n",
      "touch, like water woven into material.\n",
      "      “It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure\n",
      "it is — try it on.”\n",
      "      Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n",
      "      “It is! Look down!”\n",
      "      Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\n",
      "mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\n",
      "in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\n",
      "his reflection vanished completely.\n",
      "      “There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”\n",
      "      Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\n",
      "writing he had never seen before were the following words:  \n",
      "Your father left this in my possession before he died.\n",
      "It is time it was returned to you.\n",
      "Use it well.\n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you.\n",
      " \n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\n",
      "cloak.\n",
      "      “I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the\n",
      "matter?”\n",
      "      “Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\n",
      "it really once belonged to his father?\n",
      "      Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\n",
      "open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\n",
      "out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n",
      "      “Merry Christmas!”\n",
      "      “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”\n",
      "      Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\n",
      "on it, the other a G.\n",
      "      “Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s\n",
      "sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”\n",
      "      “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on,\n",
      "get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”\n",
      "      “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n",
      "      “You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose she\n",
      "thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we know we’re\n",
      "called Gred and Forge.”\n",
      "      “What’s all this noise?”\n",
      "      Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\n",
      "had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\n",
      "lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n",
      "      “P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even\n",
      "Harry got one.”\n",
      "      “I — don’t —  want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the\n",
      "sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n",
      "      “And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George.\n",
      "“Christmas is a time for family.”\n",
      "      They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\n",
      "his sweater.  \n",
      "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat,\n",
      "roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\n",
      "tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce –\n",
      "and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\n",
      "party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually\n",
      "bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry\n",
      "pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast\n",
      "like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\n",
      "inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High\n",
      "Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet,\n",
      "and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n",
      "      Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\n",
      "teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\n",
      "redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing\n",
      "Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and\n",
      "blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n",
      "      When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\n",
      "things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\n",
      "balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The\n",
      "white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to\n",
      "end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.\n",
      "      Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\n",
      "snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\n",
      "returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his\n",
      "new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have\n",
      "lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\n",
      "      After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\n",
      "everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch\n",
      "Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his\n",
      "prefect badge.\n",
      "      It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\n",
      "nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he\n",
      "free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\n",
      "      Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\n",
      "fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\n",
      "leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n",
      "      His father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his\n",
      "hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.       He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\n",
      "around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.\n",
      "It was a very funny feeling.\n",
      "      Use it well.\n",
      "      Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to\n",
      "him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark\n",
      "and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never\n",
      "know.\n",
      "      Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him\n",
      "back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted\n",
      "to use it alone.\n",
      "      He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\n",
      "and climbed through the portrait hole.\n",
      "      “Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\n",
      "quickly down the corridor.\n",
      "      Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\n",
      "it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long\n",
      "as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the\n",
      "invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\n",
      "      The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\n",
      "way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in\n",
      "midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave\n",
      "him the creeps.\n",
      "      The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping\n",
      "carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he\n",
      "held up his lamp to read the titles.\n",
      "      They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\n",
      "words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all. One\n",
      "book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back\n",
      "of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought\n",
      "a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\n",
      "was there who shouldn’t be.\n",
      "      He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\n",
      "he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\n",
      "and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\n",
      "very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n",
      "      A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was\n",
      "screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\n",
      "unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\n",
      "outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed\n",
      "Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and\n",
      "Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the\n",
      "book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n",
      "      He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so\n",
      "busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was\n",
      "going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all.\n",
      "There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors\n",
      "above there.\n",
      "      “You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\n",
      "wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted\n",
      "Section.”\n",
      "      Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\n",
      "know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his\n",
      "horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be\n",
      "far, we’ll catch them.”\n",
      "      Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\n",
      "ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they\n",
      "came much nearer they’d knock right into him — the cloak didn’t stop him from\n",
      "being solid.\n",
      "      He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\n",
      "was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to\n",
      "move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their\n",
      "noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\n",
      "breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\n",
      "very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\n",
      "had hidden in.\n",
      "      It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\n",
      "were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket – but\n",
      "propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it\n",
      "belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep\n",
      "it out of the way.\n",
      "      It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\n",
      "frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\n",
      "top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\n",
      "was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\n",
      "look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n",
      "      He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\n",
      "had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\n",
      "crowd of people standing right behind him.\n",
      "      But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\n",
      "the mirror.\n",
      "      There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\n",
      "reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder —\n",
      "but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a\n",
      "room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them,\n",
      "invisible or not?\n",
      "      He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\n",
      "reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air\n",
      "behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so\n",
      "close together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n",
      "      She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her\n",
      "eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\n",

      "smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\n",
      "next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\n",
      "untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.\n",
      "      Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\n",
      "that of his reflection.\n",
      "      “Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”\n",
      "      They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces\n",
      "of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other\n",
      "noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s\n",
      "knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n",
      "      The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\n",
      "them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\n",
      "right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\n",
      "joy, half terrible sadness.\n",
      "      How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not fade\n",
      "and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\n",
      "He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away\n",
      "from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\n",
      " \n",
      "“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\n",
      "      “You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\n",

      "show me your other brothers and everyone.”\n",
      "      “You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house\n",
      "this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not\n",

      "anything?”\n",
      "      Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\n",
      "again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very\n",

      "      “Don’t push me —”\n",
      "      A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\n",
      "They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\n",
      "      “Quick!”\n",
      "      Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris\n",
      "came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same\n",

      "left.\n",
      "      “This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\n",

      "      “I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had\n",
      "too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering\n",
      "around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you\n",
      "knock something over?”\n",
      "      “You sound like Hermione.”\n",
      "      “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\n",
      "      But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\n",

      " \n",
      "That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking\n",
      "so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet anyone.\n",
      "      And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\n",
      "his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of\n",
      "the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his\n",
      "family. Nothing at all.\n",
      "      Except —\n",
      "      “So — back again, Harry?”\n",
      "      Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him.\n",
      "Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he\n",
      "hadn’t noticed him.\n",
      "      “I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\n",
      "      “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said\n",
      "Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\n",
      "      “So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\n",
      "Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror\n",

      "      “I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”\n",
      "      “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\n",
      "      “It — well — it shows me my family —”\n",
      "      “And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”\n",
      "      “How did you know —?”\n",
      "      “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.\n",
      "“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”\n",
      "      Harry shook his head.\n",
      "      “Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\n",
      "Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see\n",
      "himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\n",
      "      Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want…\n",
      "whatever we want…”\n",
      "      “Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less\n",
      "than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never\n",
      "known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has\n",
      "always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best\n",
      "of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men\n",
      "have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven\n",
      "mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\n",
      "      “The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask\n",
      "you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.\n",
      "Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”\n",
      "      Harry stood up.\n",
      "      “Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”\n",
      "      “Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me\n",

      "Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n",
      "      Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\n",

      "      Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two\n",

      "      “Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\n",
      "      “Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\n",

      "      “There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\n",
      "Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.       Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the\n",
      "very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to\n",
      "Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n",
      "      “You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose\n",
      "you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”\n",
      "      Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n",
      "      “Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed.…D’you want the card, you\n",
      "collect them, don’t you?”\n",
      "      As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n",
      "      “Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\n",
      "      He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\n",
      "and Hermione.\n",
      "      “I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read\n",
      "the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this:\n",
      "‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard\n",
      "Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and\n",
      "his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\n",
      "      Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since they’d\n",
      "gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n",
      "      “Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’\n",
      "dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before\n",
      "she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n",
      "      “I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out\n",
      "of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”\n",
      "      “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked\n",
      "something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to\n",
      "herself.\n",

      "      “I knew it! I knew it!”\n",

      "of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\n",
      "      This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\n",
      "      “The what?” said Harry and Ron.\n",
      "      “Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\n",

      "a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\n",
      "sandwiches, which they refused.\n",
      "      “So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were\n",
      "wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from\n",
      "Fluffy.”\n",
      "      Hagrid frowned at him.\n",
      "      “O’ course I can’t,“ he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number\n",
      "two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s\n",
      "here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve\n",
      "worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”\n",
      "      “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\n",
      "you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm,\n",
      "flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We\n",
      "only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We\n",
      "wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\n",
      "      Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\n",
      "Hermione.\n",
      "      “Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he\n",
      "borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments…\n",
      "Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked\n",
      "them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did\n",

      "      “Snape?”\n",
      "      “Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect\n",
      "the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\n",
      "      Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\n",
      "Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\n",
      "how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except,\n",
      "it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "      “You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren’t you,\n",
      "Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not\n",
      "even one of the teachers?”\n",
      "      “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid proudly.       “Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others. “Hagrid, can we\n",
      "have a window open? I’m boiling.”\n",
      "      “Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.\n",
      "Harry looked at it, too.\n",
      "      “Hagrid — what’s that?”\n",
      "      But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath\n",
      "the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n",
      "      “Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — er…”\n",
      "      “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a\n",
      "closer look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”\n",
      "      “Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’ a few\n",
      "drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter\n",
      "get rid of it, ter be honest.”\n",
      "      “But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said Hermione.\n",
      "      “Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book\n",
      "from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for\n",
      "Pleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep the\n",
      "egg in the fire, ‘cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an’ when it hatches,\n",
      "feed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ see\n",
      "here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian\n",
      "Ridgeback. They’re rare, them.”\n",
      "      He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\n",
      "      “Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\n",
      "      But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\n",
      "fire.\n",
      " \n",
      "So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\n",
      "Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n",
      "      “Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening\n",
      "after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\n",
      "Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\n",
      "was driving them nuts.\n",
      "      Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\n",
      "Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\n",
      "      \n",
      "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\n",
      "wouldn’t hear of it.\n",
      "      “Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\n",
      "hatching?”\n",
      "      “We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\n",
      "      “Shut up!” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\n",
      "much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\n",
      "      Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\n",
      "Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning\n",
      "break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\n",
      "of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\n",
      "edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n",
      "      “It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.\n",
      "      The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\n",
      "was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n",
      "      They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n",
      "      All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\n",
      "dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\n",
      "like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\n",
      "skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\n",
      "bulging, orange eyes.\n",
      "      It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n",
      "  \n",
      "     “Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\n",
      "the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n",
      "      “Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.\n",
      "      “Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\n",
      "exactly?”\n",
      "      Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his\n",
      "face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n",
      "      “What’s the matter?”\n",
      "      “Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a kid —\n",
      "he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”\n",
      "      Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\n",
      "mistaking him.\n",
      "      Malfoy had seen the dragon.\n",
      " \n",
      "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week\n",
      "made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free\n",
      "time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n",
      "      “Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”\n",
      "      “I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”\n",
      "      They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his\n",
      "gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were\n",
      "empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n",
      "      “I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\n",
      "with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s\n",
      "Mommy?”\n",
      "      “He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear.\n",
      "      “Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to\n",
      "be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.”\n",
      "      Hagrid bit his lip.\n",
      "      “I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.”\n",
      "      Harry suddenly turned to Ron. “Charlie.” he said.\n",
      "      “You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”\n",
      "      “No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\n",
      "We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him\n",
      "back in the wild!”\n",
      "      “Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”\n",
      "      And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to\n",
      "ask him.\n",

      "The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and\n",
      "Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\n",

      "open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak.\n",
      "He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now\n",
      "eating dead rats by the crate.\n",
      "      “It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\n",

      "you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid\n",
      "goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he\n",
      "told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.”\n",

      "      It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\n",
      "agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.\n",
      " \n",
      "There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to\n",
      "twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam\n",
      "Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had\n",
      "no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s\n",
      "fangs were poisonous.\n",
      "      Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\n",
      "to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n",
      "      “It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s about\n",

      "so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her\n",
      "what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me\n",
      "— I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.”\n",
      "      Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n",

      "because they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\n",

      "      “He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a\n",

      "      “Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\n",
      "tallest tower.\n",
      "      Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the\n",
      "crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows,\n",
      "staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet\n",
      "away. A lamp flared.\n",
      "      Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\n",

      "      All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had\n",
      "just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\n",
      "with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\n",
      "      Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\n",
      "      “Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break\n",
      "his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\n",
      "      “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\n",
      "      “Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,”\n",

      "what do we do, Harry?”\n",
      "      The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione\n",
      "answered before Harry could.\n",
      "      “Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try\n",
      "anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\n",
      "      “But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us\n",
      "up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween\n",
      "and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe,\n",
      "him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it\n",
      "up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too\n",
      "friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.\n",
      "And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll\n",

      "      “If we just do a bit of poking around —”\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”\n",
      "      He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\n",
      "its moons.\n",
      " \n",
      "The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\n",
      "Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\n",

      "Professor McGonagall\n",
      " \n",
      "Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points\n",
      "they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night\n",
      "of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved\n",
      "what they’d got.\n",
      "      At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\n",
      "room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a\n",
      "detention, too.\n",
      "      “Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\n",
      "      “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you,\n",
      "eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the best teachers\n",
      "if you ask me….It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out…hang you\n",
      "by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my\n",
      "office, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…Right, off we go, and\n",
      "don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”\n",
      "      They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\n",
      "wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really\n",
      "horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.\n",
      "      The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\n",
      "into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then\n",
      "they heard a distant shout.\n",
      "      “Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”\n",
      "      Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\n",
      "wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said,\n",
      "“I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,\n",
      "boy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come\n",
      "out in one piece.”\n",
      "      At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\n",
      "tracks.\n",
      "      “The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual.\n",
      "“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there —\n",
      "werewolves, I heard.”\n",
      "      Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.\n",
      "      “That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with glee.\n",
      "“Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "      Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\n",
      "was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n",
      "      “Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All right,\n",
      "Harry, Hermione?”\n",
      "      “I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, they’re\n",
      "here to be punished, after all.”\n",
      "      “That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin lecturin’\n",
      "them, eh? ‘Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from\n",
      "here.”       “I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added\n",
      "nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away\n",
      "in the darkness.\n",
      "      Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n",
      "      “I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the\n",
      "note of panic in his voice.\n",
      "      “Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve\n",
      "done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”\n",
      "      “But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be\n",
      "copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d—”\n",
      "      “—tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. “Copyin’ lines!\n",
      "What good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh\n",
      "think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’\n",
      "pack. Go on.”\n",
      "      Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\n",
      "gaze.\n",
      "      “Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ‘cause it’s dangerous\n",
      "what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over\n",
      "here a moment.”\n",
      "      He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\n",
      "pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black\n",
      "trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\n",
      "      “Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery\n",
      "stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\n",
      "This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re\n",
      "gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”\n",
      "      “And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy,\n",
      "unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\n",
      "      “There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or\n",
      "Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter\n",
      "two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the\n",
      "place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.”\n",
      "      “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.\n",
      "      “All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry,\n",
      "an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if\n",
      "any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out\n",
      "an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks,\n",
      "an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\n",
      "      The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\n",
      "Neville, and Fang took the right.\n",
      "      They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\n",
      "ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\n",
      "the fallen leaves.\n",
      "      Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n",
      "      “Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.\n",
      "      “Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re\n",
      "powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”\n",
      "      They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\n",
      "there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\n",
      "blood here and there along the winding path.\n",
      "      “You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it can’t’ve\n",
      "gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT\n",
      "TREE!”\n",
      "      Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\n",
      "a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\n",
      "ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\n",
      "leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\n",
      "squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n",
      "      “I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”\n",
      "      “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\n",
      "      “That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid\n",
      "grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”\n",
      "      They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\n",
      "in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n",
      "      “Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”\n",
      "      And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\n",
      "man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut\n",
      "body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.\n",
      "      “Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”\n",
      "      He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.\n",
      "      “Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\n",
      "voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”\n",
      "      “Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\n",
      "“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione\n",
      "Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, you two. He’s\n",
      "a centaur.\n",
      "      “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.       “Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn\n",
      "much, up at the school?”\n",
      "      “Erm —”\n",
      "      “A bit,” said Hermione timidly.\n",
      "      “A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\n",
      "and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter\n",
      "yeh, Ronan, ‘cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”\n",
      "      Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\n",
      "sighed again.\n",
      "      “Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for\n",
      "ages past, so it is now.”\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’ Ronan? Anythin’\n",
      "unusual?”\n",
      "      “Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\n",
      "impatiently. “Unusually bright.”\n",
      "      “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home, said\n",
      "Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”\n",
      "      Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\n",
      "hides many secrets.”\n",
      "      A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\n",
      "but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\n",
      "than Ronan.\n",
      "      “Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”\n",
      "      “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”\n",
      "      “Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in\n",
      "here lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”\n",
      "      Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\n",
      "bright tonight,” he said simply.\n",
      "      “We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\n",
      "anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”\n",
      "      Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\n",
      "shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n",
      "      “Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a\n",
      "centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”\n",
      "      “Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\n",
      "      “Oh, a fair few….Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re\n",
      "good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind,\n",

      "      “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll come back\n",
      "for yeh!”\n",
      "      They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\n",
      "looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the\n",
      "rustling of leaves around them.\n",
      "      “You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.\n",
      "      “I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our fault\n",
      "he’s here in the first place.”\n",
      "      The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry’s\n",
      "seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\n",
      "going on? Where were the others?\n",
      "      At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy,\n",
      "Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\n",
      "sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\n",
      "sent up the sparks.\n",
      "      “We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were\n",
      "makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’\n",
      "Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a\n",
      "whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta\n",
      "get this done.”\n",
      "      So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\n",
      "walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\n",
      "became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\n",
      "thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\n",
      "of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\n",
      "Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\n",
      "oak.\n",
      "      “Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n",
      "      Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n",
      "      It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\n",
      "anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\n",
      "      Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\n",
      "freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.…Then, out\n",
      "of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\n",
      "stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\n",
      "reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and\n",
      "began to drink its blood.\n",
      "      “AAAAAAAAAARGH!”\n",
      "      Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded\n",
      "figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling\n",
      "down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t\n",
      "move for fear.\n",
      "      Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\n",
      "his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\n",
      "behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\n",
      "figure.\n",
      "      The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\n",
      "or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\n",
      "over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\n",
      "and a palomino body.\n",
      "      “Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n",
      "      “Yes — thank you — what was that?”\n",
      "      The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\n",
      "sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\n",
      "out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.\n",
      "      “You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\n",
      "The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\n",
      "quicker this way.\n",
      "      “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\n",
      "legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n",
      "      There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\n",
      "clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\n",
      "and sweaty.\n",
      "      “Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\n",
      "your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\n",
      "      “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\n",
      "quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\n",
      "      “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze,\n",
      "we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?”\n",
      "      Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was\n",
      "acting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\n",
      "      Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\n",
      "      “For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\n",
      "what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\n",
      "stray humans in our forest!”\n",
      "      Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\n",
      "grab his shoulders to stay on.\n",
      "      “Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not\n",
      "understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\n",
      "set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\n",
      "alongside me if I must.”\n",
      "      And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\n",
      "they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n",
      "      Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\n",
      "      “Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\n",
      "from, anyway?”\n",
      "      Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\n",
      "of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their\n",
      "way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t\n",
      "want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\n",
      "patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\n",
      "      “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn\n",
      "and tail hair in Potions.”\n",
      "      “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.\n",
      "“Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\n",
      "crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\n",
      "death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\n",
      "save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\n",
      "the blood touches your lips.”\n",
      "      Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in\n",
      "the moonlight.\n",
      "      “But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to\n",
      "be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\n",
      "      “It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\n",
      "to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength\n",
      "and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\n",
      "      “The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t\n",
      "understand who —”\n",
      "      “Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\n",
      "who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\n",
      "      It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart.\n",
      "Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\n",
      "him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\n",
      "Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\n",
      "      “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\n",
      "      “Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\n",
      "      Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\n",
      "behind her.\n",
      "      “I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The\n",
      "unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”\n",
      "      “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\n",
      "examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\n",
      "      Harry slid off his back.\n",
      "      “Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read\n",
      "wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\n",

      "an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted…but he had ter be sure I could handle\n",
      "it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home….So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon\n",
      "would be easy.…”\n",
      "      “And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to\n",
      "keep his voice calm.\n",
      "      “Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around\n",
      "Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him\n",
      "down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep —”\n",
      "      Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n",
      "      “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey —\n",
      "where’re yeh goin’?”\n",
      "      Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they\n",
      "came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the\n",
      "grounds.\n",
      "      “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger\n",
      "how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak —\n",
      "it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s\n",
      "Dumbledore’s office?”\n",
      "      They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right\n",
      "direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\n",
      "anyone who had been sent to see him.\n",
      "      “We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the\n",
      "hall.\n",
      "      “What are you three doing inside?”\n",
      "      It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n",
      "      “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely,\n",
      "Harry and Ron thought.\n",
      "      “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\n",
      "this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\n",
      "      Harry swallowed — now what?\n",
      "      “It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because\n",
      "Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.\n",
      "      “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He\n",
      "received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at\n",
      "once.”\n",
      "      “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”\n",
      "      “Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\n",
      "demands on his time – ”\n",
      "      “But this is important.”\n",
      "      “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\n",
      "Magic, Potter?”\n",
      "      “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s\n",
      "about the Sorcerer’s Stone —”\n",
      "      Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books\n",
      "she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.\n",
      "      “How do you know —?” she spluttered.\n",
      "      “Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going to try\n",
      "and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”\n",
      "      She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n",
      "      “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I don’t\n",
      "know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly\n",
      "steal it, it’s too well protected.”\n",
      "      “But Professor —”\n",
      "      “Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down\n",
      "and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.”\n",
      "      But they didn’t.\n",
      "      “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\n",
      "out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out\n",
      "everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that\n",
      "note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\n",
      "up.”\n",
      "      “But what can we —”\n",
      "      Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n",
      "      Snape was standing there.\n",
      "      “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.\n",
      "      They stared at him.\n",
      "      “You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "      “We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n",
      "      “You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this,\n",
      "people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to\n",
      "lose any more points, can it?”\n",
      "      Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n",
      "      “Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will\n",
      "personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”\n",
      "      He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n",
      "      Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n",
      "      “Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us\n",
      "has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if\n",
      "he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”\n",
      "      “Why me?”\n",
      "      “It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\n",
      "Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so\n",
      "worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”\n",
      "      “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\n",
      "Snape.\n",
      "      “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron.\n",
      "“Come on.”\n",
      "      But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the\n",
      "door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall\n",
      "turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n",
      "      “I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of\n",
      "enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes,\n",
      "Weasley, from my own house!”\n",
      "      Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At\n",
      "least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open\n",
      "and Hermione came in.\n",
      "      “I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I\n",
      "was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and\n",
      "I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\n",
      "      “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.\n",
      "      The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n",
      "      “I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone\n",
      "first.”\n",
      "      “You’re mad!” said Ron.\n",
      "      “You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have\n",
      "said? You’ll be expelled!”\n",
      "      “SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold\n",
      "of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like\n",
      "when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled\n",
      "from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points\n",
      "doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your\n",
      "families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get\n",
      "to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to\n",
      "find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never\n",
      "going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\n",
      "you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\n",
      "      He glared at them.\n",
      "      “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\n",
      "      “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”\n",
      "      “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.\n",
      "      “All — all three of us?”\n",
      "      “Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”\n",
      "      “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to\n",
      "the Stone without us? I’d better go and took through my books, there might be\n",
      "something useful….”\n",
      "      “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”\n",
      "      “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret\n",
      "that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me\n",
      "out after that.”\n",
      "  After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\n",
      "Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\n",
      "any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione\n",
      "was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the\n",
      "enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much.\n",
      "Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n",
      "      Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n",
      "      “Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\n",
      "stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out\n",
      "the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.\n",
      "He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.\n",
      "      He ran back down to the common room.\n",
      "      “We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\n",
      "– if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —”\n",
      "      “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\n",
      "appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as\n",
      "though he’d been making another bid for freedom.\n",
      "      “Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\n",
      "behind his back.\n",
      "      Neville stared at their guilty faces.\n",
      "      “You’re going out again,” he said.\n",
      "      “No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed,\n",
      "Neville?”\n",
      "      Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford\n",
      "to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n",
      "      “You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will\n",
      "be in even more trouble.”\n",
      "      “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”\n",
      "      But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n",
      "      I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait\n",
      "hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”\n",
      "      “Neville, “Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot\n",
      "—”\n",
      "      “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. I don’t think you should be\n",
      "breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\n",
      "people!”\n",
      "      “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t know\n",
      "what you’re doing.”\n",
      "      He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.\n",
      "      “Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!”\n",
      "      Harry turned to Hermione.\n",
      "      “Do something,” he said desperately.\n",
      "      Hermione stepped forward.\n",
      "      “Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”\n",
      "      She raised her wand.\n",
      "      “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n",
      "      Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\n",
      "body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a\n",
      "board.\n",
      "      Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so\n",
      "he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n",
      "      “What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so\n",
      "sorry.”\n",
      "      “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.\n",
      "      “You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and\n",
      "pulled on the invisibility cloak.\n",
      "      But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very\n",
      "good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every\n",
      "distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot\n",
      "of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n",
      "      “Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but\n",
      "Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned\n",
      "her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.\n",
      "      They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\n",
      "third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people\n",
      "would trip.\n",
      "      “Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\n",
      "narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you.\n",
      "Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”\n",
      "      He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n",
      "      “Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.”\n",
      "      Harry had a sudden idea.\n",
      "      “Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own\n",
      "reasons for being invisible.”\n",
      "      Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and\n",
      "hovered about a foot off the stairs.       “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My\n",
      "mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible —\n",
      "forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”\n",
      "      “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this\n",
      "place tonight.”\n",
      "      “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again.\n",
      "“Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”\n",
      "      And he scooted off.\n",
      "      “Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\n",
      "      A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor —\n",
      "and the door was already ajar.\n",
      "      “Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past\n",
      "Fluffy.”\n",
      "      Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\n",
      "what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n",
      "      “If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the\n",
      "cloak, I won’t need it now.”\n",
      "      “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “We’re coming,” said Hermione.\n",
      "      Harry pushed the door open.\n",
      "      As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the\n",
      "dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.\n",
      "      “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\n",
      "      “Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\n",
      "      “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here\n",
      "goes ….”\n",
      "      He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but\n",
      "from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\n",
      "Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\n",
      "then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n",
      "      “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\n",
      "crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they\n",
      "approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said\n",
      "Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”\n",
      "      “No, I don’t!”\n",
      "      “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s\n",
      "legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n",
      "      “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\n",
      "      “Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.”\n",
      "      Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention\n",
      "and pointed at himself.\n",
      "      “You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep\n",
      "this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”\n",
      "      Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled\n",
      "and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\n",
      "sleep.\n",
      "      Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\n",
      "no sign of the bottom.\n",
      "      He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\n",
      "fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t\n",
      "follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”\n",
      "      “Right,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “See you in a minute, I hope …”\n",
      "      And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\n",
      "down and —\n",
      "      FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\n",
      "soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\n",
      "he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n",
      "      “It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\n",
      "was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”\n",
      "      Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n",
      "      “What’s this stuff?” were his first words.\n",
      "      “Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall.\n",
      "Come on, Hermione!”\n",
      "      The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\n",
      "Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.\n",
      "      “We must be miles under the school,” she said.\n",
      "      “Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.\n",
      "      “Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”\n",
      "      She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\n",
      "because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\n",
      "tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\n",
      "bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n",
      "      Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\n",
      "her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\n",
      "but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\n",
      "around them.       “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s\n",
      "Devil’s Snare!”\n",
      "      “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled\n",
      "Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. “Shut\n",
      "up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.\n",
      "      “Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\n",
      "curled around his chest.\n",
      "      “Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare…what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes\n",
      "the dark and the damp.”\n",
      "      “So light a fire!” Harry choked.\n",
      "      “Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "      “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR\n",
      "NOT?”\n",
      "      “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\n",
      "muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on\n",
      "Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip\n",
      "as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it\n",
      "unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n",
      "      “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he\n",
      "joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n",
      "      “Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis —\n",
      "‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\n",
      "      “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was\n",
      "the only way forward.\n",
      "      All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water\n",
      "trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was\n",
      "reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the\n",
      "dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a\n",
      "fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\n",
      "      “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\n",
      "      Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\n",
      "ahead.\n",
      "      “Do you think it’s a ghost?”\n",
      "      “I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\n",
      "      “There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\n",
      "      They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a\n",
      "brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\n",
      "jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n",
      "      “Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.\n",
      "      “Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if\n",
      "they all swooped down at once…well, there’s no other choice…I’ll run.”\n",
      "      He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\n",
      "across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any\n",
      "second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the\n",
      "handle, but it was locked.\n",
      "      The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\n",
      "wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n",
      "      “Now what?” said Ron.\n",
      "      “These birds…they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.\n",
      "      They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?\n",
      "      “They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged keys\n",
      "— look carefully. So that must mean…” he looked around the chamber while the\n",
      "other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “…yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve\n",
      "got to catch the key to the door!”\n",
      "      “But there are hundreds of them!”\n",
      "      Ron examined the lock on the door.\n",
      "      “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the\n",
      "handle.”\n",
      "      They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\n",
      "the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched\n",
      "keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n",
      "      Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\n",
      "had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving\n",
      "about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that\n",
      "had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\n",
      "keyhole.\n",
      "      “That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — no, there\n",
      "— with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.”\n",
      "      Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\n",
      "the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n",
      "      “We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key\n",
      "with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay\n",
      "below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”\n",
      "      Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and\n",
      "Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\n",
      "nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n",
      "      They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his\n",
      "hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock\n",
      "had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had\n",
      "been caught twice.\n",
      "      “Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\n",
      "nodded. He pulled the door open.\n",
      "      The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as\n",
      "they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "      They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\n",
      "chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like\n",
      "black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry,\n",
      "Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no\n",
      "faces.\n",
      "      “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the\n",
      "room.”\n",
      "      Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\n",
      "      “How?” said Hermione nervously.\n",
      "      “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”\n",
      "      He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s\n",
      "horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\n",
      "knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n",
      "      “Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight\n",
      "nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n",
      "      “This needs thinking about…” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the\n",
      "place of three of the black pieces….”\n",
      "      Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n",
      "“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\n",
      "—”\n",
      "      “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”\n",
      "      “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\n",
      "to him instead of that castle.”\n",
      "      “What about you?”\n",
      "      “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.\n",
      "      The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\n",
      "knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\n",
      "off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.       “White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board.\n",
      "“Yes…look…”\n",
      "      A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n",
      "      Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\n",
      "sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n",
      "      “Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”\n",
      "      Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\n",
      "queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\n",
      "quite still, facedown.\n",
      "      “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to\n",
      "take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”\n",
      "      Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\n",
      "Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\n",
      "Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\n",
      "himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\n",
      "lost black ones.\n",
      "      “We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me\n",
      "think…”\n",
      "      The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n",
      "      “Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”\n",
      "      “NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\n",
      "      “That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I\n",
      "take one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate\n",
      "the king, Harry!”\n",
      "      “But —”\n",
      "      “Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\n",
      "      “Ron —”\n",
      "      “Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”\n",
      "      There was no alternative.\n",
      "      “Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now,\n",
      "don’t hang around once you’ve won.”\n",
      "      He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\n",
      "across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione\n",
      "screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\n",
      "He looked as if he’d been knocked out.\n",
      "      Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n",
      "      The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had\n",
      "won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\n",
      "last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\n",
      "      “What if he’s —?”\n",
      "      “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you\n",
      "reckon’s next?”\n",
      "      “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put\n",
      "charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\n",
      "that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\n",
      "      They had reached another door.\n",
      "      “All right?” Harry whispered.\n",
      "      “Go on.”\n",
      "      Harry pushed it open.\n",
      "      A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\n",
      "robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\n",
      "them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\n",
      "lump on its head.\n",
      "      “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they\n",
      "stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\n",
      "      He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\n",
      "came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\n",
      "seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n",
      "      “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\n",
      "      They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\n",
      "them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\n",
      "instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n",
      "      “Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\n",
      "looked over her shoulder to read it:\n",
      " \n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n",
      "Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead,\n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead,\n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;\n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end,\n",
      "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n",
      " \n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\n",
      "the very last thing he felt like doing.\n",
      "      “Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A\n",
      "lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here\n",
      "forever.”\n",
      "      “But so will we, won’t we?”\n",
      "      \n",
      " “Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this\n",
      "paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\n",
      "through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\n",
      "      “But how do we know which to drink?”\n",
      "      “Give me a minute.”\n",
      "      Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\n",
      "the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "      “Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black\n",
      "fire — toward the Stone.”\n",
      "      Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\n",
      "      “There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one\n",
      "swallow.”\n",
      "      They looked at each other.\n",
      "      “Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”\n",
      "      Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n",
      "      “You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\n",
      "brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past\n",
      "Fluffy — go straight to  the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\n",
      "him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,\n",
      "really.”\n",
      "      “But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”\n",
      "      “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I\n",
      "might get lucky again.”\n",
      "      Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\n",
      "arms around him.\n",
      "      \n",
      "“Hermione!”\n",
      "      “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”       “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\n",
      "him.\n",
      "      “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more\n",
      "important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”\n",
      "      “You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”\n",
      "      “Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\n",
      "the end, and shuddered.\n",
      "      “It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.\n",
      "      “No — but it’s like ice.”\n",
      "      “Quick, go, before it wears off.”\n",

Harry is plagued by nightmares and a persistent pain in his scar, which he believes is a warning of danger.\n",

Harry becomes convinced that Snape is planning to steal the Stone that night.\n",

      "      “Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I\n",
      "did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\n",
      "straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat\n",
      "you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off\n",
      "properly.\n",
      "      “Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”\n",
      "      It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\n",
      "was the Mirror of Erised.\n",
      "      “This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping\n",
      "his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like\n",
      "this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\n",
      "      All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\n",
      "from concentrating on the mirror.\n",
      "      “I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.\n",
      "      “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\n",
      "“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected\n",
      "me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord\n",
      "Voldemort on my side….”\n",
      "      Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n",
      "      “I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”\n",
      "      Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He\n",
      "had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n",
      "      “But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\n",
      "      “Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\n",
      "with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never\n",
      "wanted you dead.”\n",
      "      “But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was\n",
      "threatening you.…”\n",
      "      For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.\n",
      "      “Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions\n",
      "— he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\n",
      "      “You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.\n",
      "      “He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I\n",
      "traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\n",
      "ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\n",
      "is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it…Since\n",
      "then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\n",
      "has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive\n",
      "mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\n",
      "displeased. He punished me…decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me.…”\n",
      "      Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\n",
      "Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very\n",
      "day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n",
      "      Quirrell cursed under his breath.\n",
      "      “I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?”\n",
      "      Harry’s mind was racing.\n",
      "      What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\n",
      "thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\n",
      "should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how\n",
      "can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\n",
      "      He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\n",
      "noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\n",
      "Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n",
      "      “What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\n",
      "      And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\n",
      "from Quirrell himself.\n",
      "      “Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\n",
      "      Quirrell rounded on Harry.\n",
      "      “Yes — Potter — come here.”\n",
      "      He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\n",
      "got slowly to his feet.\n",
      "      “Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what\n",
      "you see.”\n",
      "      Harry walked toward him.\n",
      "      \n",
      "I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see,\n",
      "that’s all.\n",
      "      Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\n",
      "seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of\n",
      "the mirror, and opened them again.\n",
      "      He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\n",
      "later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\n",
      "blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did\n",
      "so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly\n",
      "— he’d gotten the Stone.\n",
      "      “Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”\n",
      "      Harry screwed up his courage.\n",
      "      “I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I — I’ve\n",
      "won the house cup for Gryffindor.”       Quirrell cursed again.\n",
      "      “Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\n",
      "Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n",
      "      But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\n",
      "Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.\n",
      "      “He lies…He lies.…”\n",
      "      “Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did\n",
      "you just see?”\n",
      "      The high voice spoke again.\n",
      "      “Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”\n",
      "      “Master, you are not strong enough!”\n",
      "      “I have strength enough…for this…”\n",
      "      Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t\n",
      "move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\n",
      "unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head\n",
      "looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\n",
      "      Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there\n",
      "should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible\n",
      "face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for\n",
      "nostrils, like a snake.\n",
      "      “Harry Potter…” it whispered.\n",
      "      Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.\n",
      "      “See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor….I\n",
      "have form only when I can share another’s body…but there have always been\n",
      "those willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn blood has\n",
      "strengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me\n",
      "in the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body\n",
      "of my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”\n",
      "      So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. He\n",
      "stumbled backward.\n",
      "      “Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join\n",
      "me…or you’ll meet the same end as your parents…They died begging me for\n",
      "mercy…”\n",
      "      “LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.\n",
      "      Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\n",
      "him. The evil face was now smiling.\n",
      "      “How touching…” it hissed. “I always value bravery….Yes, boy, your\n",
      "parents were brave…I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous\n",
      "fight…but your mother needn’t have died…she was trying to protect you…Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.”\n",
      "      “NEVER!”\n",
      "      Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE\n",
      "HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At\n",
      "once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it\n",
      "was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\n",
      "surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked\n",
      "around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\n",
      "looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.\n",
      "      “Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\n",
      "lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands\n",
      "around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he\n",
      "could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n",
      "      “Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”\n",
      "      And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\n",
      "of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they\n",
      "looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n",
      "      “Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.\n",
      "      Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct,\n",
      "reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —\n",
      "      “AAAARGH!”\n",
      "      Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\n",
      "Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his\n",
      "only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\n",
      "from doing a curse.\n",
      "      Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\n",
      "as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in\n",
      "Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s\n",
      "terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other\n",
      "voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”\n",
      "      He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\n",
      "fell into blackness, down…down… down….\n",
      " \n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\n",
      "but his arms were too heavy.\n",
      "      He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\n",
      "strange.\n",
      "      He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\n",
      "view above him.       “Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\n",
      "      Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was\n",
      "Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”\n",
      "      “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said\n",
      "Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”\n",
      "      “Then who does? Sir, I —”\n",
      "      “Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”\n",
      "      Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\n",
      "hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\n",
      "was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n",
      "      “Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.\n",
      "“What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\n",
      "complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends\n",
      "Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\n",
      "seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\n",
      "it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\n",
      "      “How long have I been in here?”\n",
      "      “Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\n",
      "relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”\n",

      "      “I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\n",

      "      “You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”\n",
      "      “We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\n",

      "      “You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer –”\n",
      "      “Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\n",
      "terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\n",
      "destroyed.”\n",
      "      “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —”\n",
      "      “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite\n",
      "delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have\n",
      "had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”\n",
      "      “But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”\n",
      "      “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.”\n",
      "      Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.\n",
      "      “To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\n",
      "Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\n",
      "well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\n",
      "was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\n",
      "want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble\n",
      "is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "      Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\n",
      "at the ceiling.\n",
      "      “Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone,\n",
      "Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\n",
      "      “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\n",

      "he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\n",
      "      “No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\n",
      "for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\n",
      "Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\n",
      "will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\n",
      "battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\n",
      "return to power.”\n",
      "      Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\n",

      "things I want to know the truth about.…”\n",
      "      “The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and\n",

      "deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\n",

Quirrell explains that he was the one who tried to kill Harry during the Quidditch match and that Snape was actually trying to save him. Quirrell also reveals that he let the troll into the school and that he has been serving Lord Voldemort, who is sharing his body. Quirrell tries to get the Stone from Harry using the Mirror of Erised, but Harry manages to outsmart him and retrieve the Stone. Quirrell's true form is revealed to be Voldemort, who tries to convince Harry to give him the Stone. However, Harry manages to defeat Quirrell/Voldemort by touching him, causing him to disintegrate. \n",

Mr. Dursley, a big, beefy man who works at a drill company, and Mrs. Dursley, a thin and blonde woman, have a son named Dudley whom they dote on. The Dursleys have a secret fear of the Potters, particularly Mrs. Dursley\\'s sister and her husband, who are considered unconventional.\\nThe chapter begins with Mr. Dursley going about his normal routine, unaware of the strange occurrences happening around him. He notices a cat reading a map, encounters oddly dressed people in town, and hears rumors about the Potters. These events unsettle him, but he tries to dismiss them as coincidences.\\nLater that night, Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore meet on Privet Drive to discuss the recent events involving the Potters. They reveal that Voldemort, a dark wizard, has been defeated and that Harry Potter, the Potters\\' son, survived an attack that left his parents dead. Dumbledore entrusts Harry to the care of the Dursleys, much to Professor McGonagall\\'s dismay.\\nHagrid, a giant of a man, arrives on a motorcycle to deliver Harry to the Dursleys. He is emotional about the loss of the Potters and the fate of Harry. Dumbledore leaves Harry on the Dursleys\\' doorstep with a letter explaining his situation before they all depart.\\nThe chapter ends with Dumbledore using a magical device to restore the street to normal and bidding Harry good luck. Harry, unaware of his destiny, sleeps peacefully as the wizarding world celebrates his survival.

The chapter begins with a description of the Dursley household, where Harry is mistreated and neglected by his aunt, uncle, and cousin. Despite his difficult circumstances, Harry remains hopeful and tries to make the best of his situation.\\nOn Dudley's birthday, the Dursleys plan to take him to the zoo, leaving Harry behind with their neighbor, Mrs. Figg. However, when Mrs. Figg is unable to watch Harry due to a broken leg, he is forced to accompany the Dursleys to the zoo. While there, Harry has a chance encounter with a boa constrictor in the reptile house, which communicates with him. When Dudley and his friend provoke the snake, it escapes from its enclosure, causing chaos in the zoo.\\nAfter the incident, Harry is punished by the Dursleys and forced to stay in his cupboard. Despite his mistreatment, Harry remains hopeful for a better future and dreams of a life beyond the Dursleys. The chapter ends with Harry reflecting on his past and the mysterious encounters he has had with strangers who seem to know him.\\nOverall, Chapter Two sets the stage for Harry's journey and introduces themes of family, mistreatment, and hope that will be central to the rest of the story. It also hints at the magical world that Harry is destined to discover.\"), Document(metadata={'chapter': 3}, page_content='In Chapter Three of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone,\" titled \"Letters from No One,\" Harry Potter is depicted as having a difficult summer holiday with his abusive relatives, the Dursleys.

In contrast, Harry is set to attend Stonewall High, a less prestigious school. \\nHarry receives his first ever letter, which is addressed to him in his cramped cupboard under the stairs where he is forced to sleep. However, Uncle Vernon, Harry\\'s uncle, intercepts the letter and destroys it before Harry can read it. Despite Uncle Vernon\\'s efforts to keep Harry isolated, more letters begin to arrive for Harry, causing Uncle Vernon to become increasingly paranoid and desperate to escape the letters. \\nIn a bid to avoid the letters, Uncle Vernon takes the family on a chaotic journey, eventually ending up in a remote shack during a storm. As Harry\\'s eleventh birthday approaches, a mysterious knocking is heard at the door of the shack, signaling the beginning of a new and magical chapter in Harry\\'s life.
